# Shot

A minimal, native macOS screenshot app that works locally. Capture and edit with
a few keystrokes.

## Features

- **Command–Shift–1** captures an area and extracts editable text with OCR.
- **Command–Shift–2** captures an area as a movable, resizable floating pin.
- **Command–Shift–3** captures the display containing the pointer.
- **Command–Shift–4** captures an area and opens the image editor.
- The image editor is fully keyboard driven.
- Optional keyboard selection draws the capture area with vim keys.

## Keyboard

The image editor is driven from the keyboard: `P` `R` `A` `T` pick a tool,
`1`–`6` pick a color, `[` `]` change thickness or text size, and `hjkl` or the
arrow keys move a cursor on the image to draw shapes without the mouse.
Command–`S` saves, Command–`C` copies, and Escape copies and closes.

The capture overlay can work the same way once **Keyboard Selection** is turned
on in the menu bar.

Press `?` in either place for the full list, or read
[docs/keyboard.md](docs/keyboard.md).

## Install

Build Shot from source on your Mac.

Prerequisite: Xcode Command Line Tools.

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

Clone, build, and open Shot:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/santheipman/shot.git
cd shot
./scripts/build-app.sh release
open dist/Shot.app
```

The app is built at `dist/Shot.app`. On first launch, allow Shot under **System
Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording** (or **Screen & System Audio
Recording**), then restart it:

```sh
./scripts/rebuild-and-restart.sh
```

## Trust and privacy

- Shot works locally with no network requests, analytics, updater, or remote
  dependencies. OCR uses Apple Vision on your Mac.
- Shot only asks for screen-recording permission. Source builds are locally
  signed, but not Apple-notarized or protected by macOS App Sandbox.
